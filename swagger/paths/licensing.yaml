    summary: Update license seats and features
    description: |
      Updates the number of seats for different license tiers and features for a customer.
      Requires JWT authentication with a payload hash of the request body.

      **Restrictions:**

      * Seat quantities (`digitalOnlySeats`, `essentialSeats`, etc.) must be integers. See the schema for minimum values.
      * `workforceOptimizationSeats` and `workforceManagementSeats` have a minimum value of 10.
      * `speechAnalyticsSeats` and `dialerSeats` have a minimum value of 5.
      * `additionalAiMessages` is the number of additional AI messages and requires at least one `eliteSeats`.

      **Authentication Requirements**

      Each request must include:
      * A JWT with the following in its payload:
        * A payload hash of the request body
        * A unique `jti` (JWT ID) - never reuse IDs
        * An `exp` (expiration) timestamp - max 30 minutes in the future

      **Signature Generation**

      To ensure data integrity, the request body must be signed.

      1.  **Request Body Preparation:**
          * Prepare your license update request properties
      2.  **JSON Serialization:**
          * Serialize the JSON request body using `json.dumps` (or an equivalent function in your programming language) with the following parameters:
              * `sort_keys=False` (to preserve property order)
              * `separators=(',', ':')` (to minimize whitespace)
          * This will produce a compact JSON string with no unnecessary whitespace.
      3.  **UTF-8 Encoding:** Encode the resulting JSON string as UTF-8.
      4.  **Hashing:** Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the UTF-8 encoded JSON string.
      5.  Include the resulting hash in the `payload_hash` claim of your JWT along with `jti` and `exp` claims.

      **Example (Python)**

      ```python
      import json
      import hashlib
      import uuid
      import time

      # License update payload WITHOUT jti or exp
      payload = {
          "serial": "EXAMPLECUSTOMER1D57107A415DEE77F",
          "digitalOnlySeats": 10,
          "essentialSeats": 10,
          "professionalSeats": 10,
          "eliteSeats": 10,
          "workforceOptimizationSeats": 10,
          "workforceManagementSeats": 10,
          "speechAnalyticsSeats": 5,
          "dialerSeats": 5,
          "additionalAiMessages": 5000
      }

      # Serialize the JSON (important: with specific parameters)
      payload_string = json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=False, separators=(',', ':')).encode('utf-8')

      # Calculate the hash
      payload_hash = hashlib.sha256(payload_string).hexdigest()

      # Current time and expiration (30 minutes in the future)
      current_time = int(time.time())
      expiration_time = current_time + (30 * 60)

      # Create JWT payload with security claims
      jwt_payload = {
          "payload_hash": payload_hash,
          "jti": str(uuid.uuid4()),  # Unique ID for this request
          "exp": expiration_time     # Expiration timestamp
      }

      # ... (Continue with JWT creation and signing)
      ```

      **Important:**
      * The server will perform the same JSON serialization to normalize the payload before verifying the signature.
      * Adhering to the specified serialization parameters is crucial for successful signature verification.
      * The server tracks used JTIs until their expiration to prevent replay attacks.
