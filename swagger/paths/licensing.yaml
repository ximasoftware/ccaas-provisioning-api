  summary: Update license seats and features
  description: |
    Updates the number of seats for different license tiers and features for a customer.
    Requires JWT authentication with certificate fingerprint-based Key IDs following RFC 7515/7517 standards.

    **Validation Rules:**

    * All fields except `ccId` are optional
    * For optional seat fields: Must be either `0` (remove license) or meet minimum requirements
    * Basic seat types (`digitalOnlySeats`, `essentialSeats`, etc.): Minimum 5 when not 0
    * `speechAnalyticsSeats`: Minimum 5 when not 0
    * `dialerSeats`: Minimum 10 when not 0
    * AI Messaging: Mutual exclusivity - only one bundle type can be > 0 at a time
    * SIP Credentials: If present, username, password, sipServer, and outboundProxy are required. sipPort and transport are optional but must be provided together (when omitted, SRV lookup is used)

    **Authentication Requirements (RFC 7515/7517 JWT Kid Authentication)**

    Each request must include:
    * A JWT with the following in its header:
      * `kid`: SHA-1 fingerprint of your client certificate (without colons)
    * A JWT with the following in its payload:
      * Standard RFC 7519 claims: `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `iat`, `exp`, `jti`
      * A payload hash of the request body
      * A unique `jti` (JWT ID) - never reuse IDs
      * An `exp` (expiration) timestamp - max 30 minutes in the future

    **Certificate Fingerprint Calculation**

    The `kid` (Key ID) must be the SHA-1 fingerprint of your client certificate:

    ```python
    from cryptography import x509
    import hashlib

    # Load certificate and calculate fingerprint
    with open("client-cert.crt", "rb") as f:
        cert_data = f.read()
    
    certificate = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(cert_data)
    der_bytes = certificate.public_bytes(encoding=x509.Encoding.DER)
    kid = hashlib.sha1(der_bytes).hexdigest()
    ```

    **Signature Generation**

    To ensure data integrity, the request body must be signed.

    1.  **Request Body Preparation:**
        * Prepare your license update request properties
    2.  **JSON Serialization:**
        * Serialize the JSON request body using `json.dumps` (or an equivalent function in your programming language) with the following parameters:
            * `sort_keys=False` (to preserve property order)
            * `separators=(',', ':')` (to minimize whitespace)
        * This will produce a compact JSON string with no unnecessary whitespace.
    3.  **UTF-8 Encoding:** Encode the resulting JSON string as UTF-8.
    4.  **Hashing:** Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the UTF-8 encoded JSON string.
    5.  Include the resulting hash in the `payload_hash` claim of your JWT along with RFC 7519 standard claims.

    **Example (Python)**

    ```python
    import json
    import hashlib
    import uuid
    import time
    from cryptography import x509

    # Step 1: Calculate certificate fingerprint for kid
    with open("client-cert.crt", "rb") as f:
        cert_data = f.read()
    
    certificate = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(cert_data)
    der_bytes = certificate.public_bytes(encoding=x509.Encoding.DER)
    kid = hashlib.sha1(der_bytes).hexdigest()

    # Step 2: License update payload
    payload = {
        "ccId": {
            "resellerId": "RESELLER001",
            "resellerName": "Acme Distribution",
            "tenantId": "TENANT456",
            "tenantName": "West Coast Sales"
        },
        "digitalOnlySeats": 5,
        "essentialSeats": 0,           # Remove essential seats
        "professionalSeats": 5,
        "eliteSeats": 5,
        "workforceOptimizationSeats": 10,
        "speechAnalyticsSeats": 5,
        "dialerSeats": 10,             # Minimum 10 for dialer seats
        "aiMessaging": {
            "standardBundles": 5,      # Standard bundles
            "advancedBundles": 0       # Advanced must be 0 when standard > 0
        },
        "aiAudioServices": {
            "additionalHours": 25
        },
        "sipCredentials": {
            "username": "user123",
            "password": "secret",
            "sipPort": 5061,
            "sipServer": "sip_server.example.com",
            "transport": "udp",
            "outboundProxy": "outbound.example.com"
        }
    }

    # Step 3: Serialize the JSON (important: with specific parameters)
    payload_string = json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=False, separators=(',', ':')).encode('utf-8')

    # Step 4: Calculate the hash
    payload_hash = hashlib.sha256(payload_string).hexdigest()

    # Step 5: Current time and expiration (30 minutes in the future)
    current_time = int(time.time())
    expiration_time = current_time + (30 * 60)

    # Step 6: Create JWT header with certificate fingerprint
    jwt_header = {
        "alg": "RS256",
        "typ": "JWT",
        "kid": kid  # Certificate fingerprint
    }

    # Step 7: Create JWT payload with RFC 7519 standard claims
    jwt_payload = {
        "iss": "xima-ccaas",        # Issuer (required)
        "sub": kid,                 # Subject - certificate fingerprint
        "aud": "xima-ccaas",        # Audience (required)
        "payload_hash": payload_hash,
        "jti": str(uuid.uuid4()),   # Unique ID for this request
        "exp": expiration_time,     # Expiration timestamp
        "iat": current_time         # Issued at timestamp
    }

    # ... (Continue with JWT creation and signing using RS256)
    ```

    **Important:**
    * The server will perform the same JSON serialization to normalize the payload before verifying the signature.
    * Adhering to the specified serialization parameters is crucial for successful signature verification.
    * The server tracks used JTIs until their expiration to prevent replay attacks.

    **Note:**
    * Professional and Elite seats include a base number of AI audio hours per agent.
    * An account with at least one Elite license automatically includes one (1) Standard AI Messaging bundle.
    * **Standard tier:** Each bundle provides 5,000 AI messages and 2 knowledge bases. Purchase more bundles for more capacity.
    * **Advanced tier:** Required for 3rd party integrations. Each bundle also provides 5,000 messages and 5 knowledge bases.
    * The `aiAudioServices.additionalHours` field is for purchasing additional transcription hours.

    - License Management
  summary: Schedule license resources for deletion
  description: |
    Schedules all licensing resources for a customer to be deleted. This operation marks
    resources for deletion rather than immediately removing them, allowing for administrative
    review and recovery if needed.

    **Validation Rules:**

    * Only `ccId` is required for deletion requests
    * `ccId` must be a valid object with `resellerId` and `tenantId` fields
    * All other fields are ignored in DELETE requests

    **Authentication Requirements (RFC 7515/7517 JWT Kid Authentication)**

    Each request must include:
    * A JWT with the following in its header:
      * `kid`: SHA-1 fingerprint of your client certificate (without colons)
    * A JWT with the following in its payload:
      * Standard RFC 7519 claims: `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `iat`, `exp`, `jti`
      * A payload hash of the request body
      * A unique `jti` (JWT ID) - never reuse IDs
      * An `exp` (expiration) timestamp - max 30 minutes in the future

    **Certificate Fingerprint Calculation**

    The `kid` (Key ID) must be the SHA-1 fingerprint of your client certificate:

    ```python
    from cryptography import x509
    import hashlib

    # Load certificate and calculate fingerprint
    with open("client-cert.crt", "rb") as f:
        cert_data = f.read()
    
    certificate = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(cert_data)
    der_bytes = certificate.public_bytes(encoding=x509.Encoding.DER)
    kid = hashlib.sha1(der_bytes).hexdigest()
    ```

    **Signature Generation**

    To ensure data integrity, the request body must be signed following the same process as POST requests.

    **Example (Python)**

    ```python
    import json
    import hashlib
    import uuid
    import time
    from cryptography import x509

    # Step 1: Calculate certificate fingerprint for kid
    with open("client-cert.crt", "rb") as f:
        cert_data = f.read()
    
    certificate = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(cert_data)
    der_bytes = certificate.public_bytes(encoding=x509.Encoding.DER)
    kid = hashlib.sha1(der_bytes).hexdigest()

    # Step 2: Deletion payload
    payload = {
        "ccId": {
            "resellerId": "RESELLER001",
            "tenantId": "TENANT456"
        }
    }

    # Step 3: Serialize the JSON (important: with specific parameters)
    payload_string = json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=False, separators=(',', ':')).encode('utf-8')

    # Step 4: Calculate the hash
    payload_hash = hashlib.sha256(payload_string).hexdigest()

    # Step 5: Current time and expiration (30 minutes in the future)
    current_time = int(time.time())
    expiration_time = current_time + (30 * 60)

    # Step 6: Create JWT header with certificate fingerprint
    jwt_header = {
        "alg": "RS256",
        "typ": "JWT",
        "kid": kid  # Certificate fingerprint
    }

    # Step 7: Create JWT payload with RFC 7519 standard claims
    jwt_payload = {
        "iss": "xima-ccaas",        # Issuer (required)
        "sub": kid,                 # Subject - certificate fingerprint
        "aud": "xima-ccaas",        # Audience (required)
        "payload_hash": payload_hash,
        "jti": str(uuid.uuid4()),   # Unique ID for this request
        "exp": expiration_time,     # Expiration timestamp
        "iat": current_time         # Issued at timestamp
    }

    # ... (Continue with JWT creation and signing using RS256)
    ```

    **Important:**
    * The server will perform the same JSON serialization to normalize the payload before verifying the signature.
    * Adhering to the specified serialization parameters is crucial for successful signature verification.
    * The server tracks used JTIs until their expiration to prevent replay attacks.
    * Resources are scheduled for deletion within 1 week of the request.
